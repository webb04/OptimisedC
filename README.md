# optimised-C

This is an optimised piece of code for the module Advanced Computer Architecture.

The code was optimised with a speedup of 25x.

- Loop unrolling and loop fusion were used as a prerequisite for using SSE vector intrinsics.
- SSE Vector Intrinsics, Cache Optimisation and Open MP were used for parallelisation.
